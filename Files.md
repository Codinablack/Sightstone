because there are so many projects, I thought I would make this
# Sightstone
The sightstone project is designed to initialize the window and have Caliburn.Micro do all of its magical stuff.
# Sightstone.Views
This project holds all the UI components. This is how users can change the UI.
# Sightstone.ViewModels
This project holds all the functions for the UI components. This makes rtmp calls and xmpp calls
# Sightstone.Core
This project holds classes relating to rtmp xmpp and is what the ViewModels refer to to make their calls
