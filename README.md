# Sightstone Project
Sightstone is an open-source and alternative League of Legends client. It is currently being rewritten in order to organize code and provide a better user experience. 
It is aimed to all sort of setups, letting you choose from the below three options:
  * Sightstone
  * Sightstone Light
  * Sightstone Ultra Light

#Sightstone
 It comes with a few extra features not present in the original client such as:
  * While in ARAM champions select, you are able to see enemy team champions
  * Record your games automatically and store them
  * Change client theme
  * Store various accounts safely

#Sightstone Light
As mentioned by its name, this is a light version of Sightstone. It has nothing but the original League of Legends client's functions.

#Sightstone Ultra Light
From the three options available this is the lightest version. It comes down to the basic functionality of the League of Legends Client by  removing non-essencial features like:
  * News
  * Custom games
  * Featured games
