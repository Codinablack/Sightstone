This project died

# Sightstone Project
Sightstone is an open-source and alternative League of Legends client. It is currently being rewritten in order to organize code and provide a better user experience. 
It is aimed to all sort of setups, letting you choose from the below four options:
  * Sightstone Plus
  * Sightstone
  * Sightstone Light
  * Sightstone Ultra Light

# Goals
  * Have a powerful, beautiful, secure, stunning, and easy to use client
  * Ability to run on a Surface 3, 4gb tablet (which I don't have so hopefully one of you guys have one) without latency issues
  * Be less memory and CPU intensive than Riot
  * Ability to use multiple UIs
  * Ability to install or create plugins to enhance your client experience

# TODO
  * Get the client working
  * 

# Sightstone Plus
Sightstone Plus comes extras feature not present in Sightstone (see below) such as:
  * Allows you to link social media for sharing of replays and screen-shots
  * Has a server to allow you to play and chat while away from home and everything will be recorded (Windows, Android, Windows Phone)

# Sightstone
Sightstone comes with a few extra features not present in the original client such as:
  * While in ARAM champions select, you are able to see enemy team champions
  * Record your games automatically and store them
  * Change client theme and UI
  * Store various accounts safely
  * Use the Sightstone Official Server

# Sightstone Light
As mentioned by its name, this is a light version of Sightstone. It has nothing but the original League of Legends client's functions.

# Sightstone Ultra Light
From the three options available this is the lightest version. It comes down to the basic functionality of the League of Legends Client by  removing non-essential features like:
  * News
  * Custom games
  * Featured games
